### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains the draft of a handbook on **Photobiological calculations with R**. The handbook supports a suite of R packages developed by Pedro J. Aphalo at the University of Helsinki, Finland.

### Just clone the repository ###

To build the pdf you will need LaTeX and Memoire, and R and knitr. At the moment the files are in Rnw format but will at some point possibly be reformatted using Bookdown.
